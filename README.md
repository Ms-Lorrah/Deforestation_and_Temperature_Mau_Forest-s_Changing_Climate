# Deforestation_and_Temperature_Mau_Forest-s_Changing_Climate

### Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between deforestation and temperature changes in Kenya's Mau Forest from 2015 to 2020. It employs statistical analysis and machine learning models to understand the impact of tree loss on local temperatures, providing insights into broader climate change patterns.

### Key Objectives
Tree Loss Analysis: Examine the annual tree loss in the Mau Forest to understand deforestation patterns.
Temperature Trend Analysis: Investigate temperature variations over the years in the Mau Forest.
Temperature Forecasting: Predict future temperature trends based on historical data using time series analysis.

### Data Collection
Public Datasets: Utilized Google Earth Engine for satellite imagery analysis.
APIs: Employed weather data APIs like OpenWeatherMap and Meteostat for historical temperature data.
Timeframe: Focused on weather and deforestation data for the period 2015-2020.

### Data Visualizations
#### 1. Annual Tree Loss in Mau Forest (2015-2020)

This bar chart illustrates the yearly tree loss in hectares from 2015 to 2020. A peak in deforestation is observed in 2017, followed by a gradual decline. However, deforestation remains a persistent issue that needs attention. ![Annual Tree Loss Mau Forest 2015-2020](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83568c53-f3e6-41ef-bf88-5b679ec1ca4e)


#### 2. Temperature Trends in Mau Forest (2015-2020)
The line chart shows monthly temperature variations from 2015 to 2020. The data indicates fluctuations in temperature over the years, correlating with periods of high tree loss. ![Temperature Trend In Mau Forest 2015-2020](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7f912d4-bc2d-4d06-ad69-f6eabfe54e9d)


#### 3. Temperature Forecast with Tree Loss
ARIMAX Modeling: Integrated external factors like deforestation into time series analysis to forecast future temperature trends. ![ARIMA Model Analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcf93fe3-19be-468c-959d-3a1148c39e08)


### Conclusion
This analysis reveals a correlation between deforestation in the Mau Forest and rising temperatures. By highlighting these trends, the project aims to promote awareness and drive actions toward reforestation and forest conservation, crucial for protecting the environment and local communities.

#### Future Work
Data Collection: Gather more recent data to refine analysis and forecasts.
Model Enhancements: Incorporate additional factors, such as rainfall and human activities, into predictive models for more accurate forecasts.
Policy Recommendations: Utilize the insights gained to propose actionable steps for forest conservation and sustainable management.
